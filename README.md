# KaiUIv2

KaiUIv2 is a fork of [AdrianMachado's KaiUI](https://github.com/AdrianMachado/KaiUI) which is a UI component library for building KaiOS apps. Unfortunately, that library doesn't seem to be maintained anymore and the components are for React only.

KaiUIv2 aims to provide styling, only and framework users use it to create UI libraries for the frameworks.

## Building and Usage

Simply include as dependency in your `package.json`:

```
"KaiUIv2": "git+https://github.com/farooqkz/KaiUIv2.git"
```

The only dependency of KaiUIv2 is `node-sass` which requires a Node version from 14 to 19 on most platforms including Linux, OS X and Windows.

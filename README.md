# KaiUIng

KaiUIng is a fork of [AdrianMachado's KaiUI](https://github.com/AdrianMachado/KaiUI) which is a UI component library for building KaiOS apps. Unfortunately, that library doesn't seem to be maintained anymore and the components are for React only.

KaiUIng aims to provide styling only, and framework users use it to create UI libraries for the frameworks.

For instance, to use the InfernoJS bindings, you can use KaiUIngInferno.

## Building and Usage

Simply install it with npm or yarn:

```
npm install kaiuing
yarn add kaiuing
```

### The Inferno bindings

To use the Inferno bindings:

```
yarn add kaiuing-inferno
```

There is no docs at the moment. But you can see [chooj](https://github.com/farooqkz/chooj) on how to use these components.

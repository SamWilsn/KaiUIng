# KaiUIng

KaiUIng is a fork of [AdrianMachado's KaiUI](https://github.com/AdrianMachado/KaiUI) which is a UI component library for building KaiOS apps. Unfortunately, that library doesn't seem to be maintained anymore and the components are for React only.

KaiUIng aims to provide styling only, and framework users use it to create UI libraries for the frameworks.

For instance, to use the InfernoJS bindings, you can use KaiUIngInferno.

## Building and Usage

Simply install it with npm or yarn:

```
npm install kaiuing
yarn add kaiuing
